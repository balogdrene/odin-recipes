    <p>Adorable 'deviled' chicks peek out of their eggs. Display in an egg cup or egg tray. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients for 12 servings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 hard-boiled eggs, peeled </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise </li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons yellow mustard </li>
        <li>1 dill pickle, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pickle juice </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into rounds </li>
        <li>12 slices canned black olives, or as needed </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice through the top 1/3 of each egg, ensuring some of the yolk is included in the slice. Carefully remove
            the egg yolk from the bottom portion of the egg using a spoon and transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix egg yolks, mayonnaise, mustard, pickle, horseradish, pickle juice, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
            Fill a piping bag or a plastic bag with a corner snipped with the egg yolk mixture. Pipe egg yolk mixture
            into the hollowed egg whites creating the 'chick', ensuring there is enough filling to add 'eyes' and a
            'beak.'</li>
        <li>Slice small wedges out of the carrot rounds creating 12 'beaks'. Add a 'beak' to each 'chick'.</li>
        <li>Slice olive pieces into small squares to be used as 'eyes.' Add 2 'eyes' to each 'chick.' Place the egg tops
            onto each 'chick' to look like a chick peaking out of the egg.</li>
    </ol>
